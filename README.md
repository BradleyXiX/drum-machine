# Drum Machine

This is my Submsion for the FreeCodeCamp Certification project for Front-end Libraries certificate.

A simple Drum Machine using React.

## Overview

This project implements a drum machine with nine pads corresponding to different sound clips. The interface allows users to trigger sounds by clicking on the pads or using keyboard shortcuts. 

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Pads**: Click or use keyboard shortcuts (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C) to trigger sounds.

- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

## User Stories

- **User Story #1**: Outer container with `id="drum-machine"` that holds all elements.
- **User Story #2**: Display element with `id="display"` to show the current sound.
- **User Story #3**: Nine drum pads, each with unique `id`, `class="drum-pad"`, and keyboard key as inner text.
- **User Story #4**: Each drum pad contains an audio element with `class="clip"` and `id` matching its key.
